This repository contains a version of the published IOCCG Protocols for reference and for community discussion, and Q&A through the "Discussions" feature, and direct improvements to the protocol content through the "Issues" feature. These engagements are meant to be open and accessible to all interested in using the protocol, and will help the community to better implement the protocols, as well as advance improvements and updates to the protocol versions through community discussion. See the DOI or the [IOCCG website](https://ioccg.org/what-we-do/ioccg-publications/ioccg-protocols/) for the published version (in PDF).

## Background
This document is a product of a two-and-a-half-day workshop with international participation organized by A. Neeley and hosted at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in June, 2014. The resulting protocol document, *Inherent Optical Property Measurements and Protocols: Absorption Coefficient*, and the associated working group activity were sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with additional support for contributing authors and workshop participants by their respective institutions (see Appendix for complete list of workshop participants). The document acts as an update to the 2003 NASA Technical Memorandum, providing a comprehensive overview of state- of-the-art technologies and methods for measuring the absorption of particles. This document would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of its authors.
